Virtual tables, introduced in Apache Cassandraâ„¢ 4.0, allow you to expose
metrics and properties of the node with the same interface as ordinary tables.
This allows for a much easier way to observe the state and the health
of the cluster without leaving the CQL protocol.

In this scenario you will learn:

- how to look at virtual tables and their contents
- what you _cannot_ do with virtual tables
- what to expect if you change node settings
